The first agenda entry will be highlighted. Dependent on your meeting settings, the time of the first agenda entry will be adjusted and the end time of the meeting will be calculated and shown in the title.

As soon as the time is near to the end, the color of the count down cycle will change.

In case of "automatic movement" the next agenda entry will be activated. Otherwise the color of the count down cycle will change to red and the additional time will be added to the end time of the meeting.

### Sound on

At the end of an agenda entry and at the end of the meeting a sound will be played.

### Automatic move to next agenda entry

At the end of an agenda entry the next one will be selected automatically. Otherwise the countdown circle will turn into read and a negative time will be shown. The additional time will be added to the meeting time. Thus the time when the meeting will end is transparent to you. 

### Adjust start time

This option will adjust the first agenda entry based on the current time.

Here is a simple example:
* Topic 1: 30 min
* Topic 2: 30 min

In case you start the meeting at 09:05, the time of Topic 1 will automatically be adjusted by 5 minutes.
Thus the Topic 2 will start at 09:30.

The adjustment will only be done according to the duration of the first agenda entry.

In case your first agenda entry is 5 min and you start the meeting at 9:06, nothing will be adjusted, as no "even" time within the last 5 min can be found. You would have the raise the duration to 10 min before starting the meeting in 
this case.

"Even" times means 30 min steps. 9:00, 9:30 and so on. Thus it would make sense to ether start the meeting in time
or to start you meeting with a "welcome" of 5 to 10 min (especially if you have very short agenda entries).
